Plan for Comparing Car Videos

1. Inputs
   You need two video files:
   - Video A: The car before the accident.
   - Video B: The car after the accident.

2. Step 1: Get Pictures
   - Break both videos down into individual pictures.
   - Take one picture for every second of video.

3. Step 2: Find Damages
   - Use the AI model we trained to look at the pictures from Video B (after accident).
   - The model will look for dents, scratches, and cracks.
   - Save the list of damages found and where they are in the picture.

4. Step 3: Match Pictures
   - For every picture in Video B where damage was found, try to find a picture in Video A that looks the same.
   - This is to see what that part of the car looked like before.
   - We can use basic image matching code to find the most similar picture.

5. Step 4: Compare
   - Check if the damage detected in Video B is visible in the matching picture from Video A.
   - If the damage is only in Video B, it is new damage from the accident.
   - If it is in both, it is old damage.

6. Step 5: Report
   - Create a simple list of new damages.
   - Show the "Before" and "After" pictures side by side for proof.
